This project is the source code repository for the course project taken up by Rohit Banga and Harshit Mehrotra for CSE 6240 - Web Search and Text Mining for the Spring 2012 semester at Georgia Tech.

We were keen on experimenting with Structured Relevance Models introduced in the paper by Xing Yi, James Allan and Victor Lavrenko in the following paper:
Xing Yi, James Allan, and Victor Lavrenko. 2007. Discovering missing values in semi-structured databases. In Large Scale Semantic Access to Content (Text, Image, Video, and Sound) (RIAO '07). LE CENTRE DE HAUTES ETUDES INTERNATIONALES D'INFORMATIQUE DOCUMENTAIRE, Paris, France, France, 687-701. http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1931456

The implementation is based on the description given in the above paper and we tested our implementation with the NSDL dataset (http://nsdl.org/).
